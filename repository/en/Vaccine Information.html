          <p><strong>Is the COVID-19 vaccine required for students, faculty and staff?</strong></p> 
          <p>Cal Poly Pomona students and employees are required to get the COVID-19 vaccine for the fall 2021 semester. They will be required to by Aug. 16 or they must participate in . .</p> 
          <p><strong>Is the COVID-19 vaccine required for students living on campus?<br> </strong>Yes. Due to the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission in a close, communal living setting, University Housing Services in partnership with local, state, and federal agencies will&nbsp;require&nbsp;its residents to be fully vaccinated prior to their scheduled move-in date. Students may request a medical or religious exemption.</p> 
          <p><strong>What vaccines are required for students?<br> </strong>A number of immunizations unrelated to COVID-19 are already required for student enrollment at Cal Poly Pomona. To see a full list of current required vaccines, visit the&nbsp;.</p> 
          <p><strong>What will happen to students who are not vaccinated and have not requested an exemption?</strong></p> 
          <p>After Sept. 30, any student who does not verify their vaccination and has not requested a medical or religious exemption may face disciplinary action, per CSU policy.</p> 
          <p><strong>Are fully remote students required to get vaccinated or participate in the weekly COVID-19 testing?<br> </strong>The CSU’s vaccination requirement applies to students and employees who access campus facilities for class, work, on-campus activities AND those who participate in in-person university activities off campus, such as internships, co-op, research projects. Students who are fully remote should submit a .</p> 
          <p><strong>Can faculty and staff self-attest that they will not access campus facilities or university programs?</strong><br>The self-attestation form is intended only for fully remote students who will not access campus facilities or programs. University employees and auxiliary employees may not submit the self-attestation.</p> 
          <p><strong>What will happen to employees who are not vaccinated and have not requested an exemption?</strong></p> 
          <p>This policy applies in its entirety to non-represented employees effective immediately; however, meet-and-confer sessions over policy impacts are still taking place for represented employees. As such, there shall be no consequence at this time for represented employees who do not comply, although their voluntary participation is welcomed.</p> 
          <p><strong>Why does the vaccine mandate require immediate vaccination of students and non-represented employees but not represented employees?<br> </strong>All employees are subject to this policy; however, the university must negotiate the impacts of the vaccine requirement with each applicable labor union. Until the meet-and-confer process with labor unions has reached a conclusion, the university cannot subject represented employees to consequences for failing to meet this university requirement. For students and employees who are unvaccinated during the grace period for obtaining full vaccination status (no later than Sept. 30, 2021), other safety measures will apply, as with those who are exempted.</p> 
          <p><strong>I’ve already tested positive for COVID. Do I still need to get vaccinated?</strong></p> 
          <p>Yes, you will still need to get vaccinated. The university policy does not allow for exemptions for those who have had COVID-19, and public health officials recommend vaccination for people who have previously tested positive for COVID-19.</p> 
          <p><strong>What will happen to me if I am unable to get the second vaccine in time to be fully immunized (allowing for 3-4 weeks after the first shot) before I go to campus?</strong></p> 
          <p>This should not be a problem as ample time has been built in to allow for both shots and the two weeks following. In the rare event that an individual has not completed the vaccination process, they will be required to participate in additional public health and safety measures. Students and non-represented employees should verify their vaccination record or request an exemption by Sept. 30.</p> 
          <p><strong>If medical experts determine in the future that boosters are required, will the new policy also require proof of boosters?</strong></p> 
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the CSU will continue to review the guidance from local, state, federal and global health agencies and revise the policy as needed based on the goal of maintaining the health and well-being of all members of the campus community.</p> 
          <p><strong>Where can I get a COVID-19 vaccination?</strong></p> 
          <p>Vaccines are widely available throughout the region, and they are the best way to protect yourself, your loved ones and our campus community. Go to the state’s  to make an appointment or search for a walk-in clinic.</p> 
          <p>In addition, Cal Poly Pomona will host several pop-up vaccine clinics open to everyone — students, employees, their families and members of the community. The vaccines are free to everyone, and you don’t have to be a Cal Poly Pomona student to receive one.</p>

          <p><strong>What type of documentation is needed to verify my vaccination?</strong></p>
