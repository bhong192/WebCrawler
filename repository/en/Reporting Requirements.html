       <p>This reporting guide will provide some next steps to students, faculty, staff and campus visitors who receive a positive COVID-19 test result.</p> 
       <p>The Safer Return Incident Investigation Team, working under the supervision of the Associate Vice President for Health and Wellbeing, will follow up with individuals. This process is the campus’ version of contact tracing. A team member will ask about close contacts and recent locations. They will connect individuals medical and health resources, and also connect them with other personnel for additional support as needed. Medical privacy will be maintained throughout the process.</p> 
       <p>Cal Poly Pomona’s reporting procedures are aligned with the requirements set by LA County Public Health, the CSU Chancellor’s Office, Cal/OSHA and other health authorities. In addition, the university is following notification protocols to communicate potential exposures on campus to the impacted individuals.</p>
