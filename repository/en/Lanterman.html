      <p>Cal Poly Pomona intends to embark on an ambitious and long range plan in conjunction with a master developer to revitalize the former Lanterman site into a thriving and active community that allows people to live, learn, work, play. The university and master developer will seek input from the community as we explore this unique opportunity for the region. The guiding principle is that the development support and advance the university’s educational mission and values, and benefit the surrounding communities.</p> 
      <p>Over the past several months the university has been engaged in a selection process for a master development partner for the 300-acres and selected the team of Edgewood Realty Partners &amp; Greystar as the master developer that will partner with us to revitalize the site.&nbsp; This is an important milestone in advancing our vision for Lanterman, in supporting our university mission and values and in contributing to the economic and social vitality of the surrounding communities and region.</p>

       <p class="lead"> </p>
       <p>The site, once operated by the California Department of Developmental Services, became available to Cal Poly Pomona in 2016 through a Memorandum of Understanding with the state. After a year of study and analysis, the university informed the CSU Board of Trustees that it was interested in undertaking the process to secure the property and begin the steps to identify a master developer to manage the process.&nbsp;Here is a timeline of the process.</p>

       <p>A project of this scope has naturally generated many questions. What does Cal Poly Pomona plan to do with the Lanterman site? Can the public weigh in on how the property should be developed? What kind of uses will the university consider for the site? Will it be connected with the main campus? Find the answers to these and other questions here.</p>
