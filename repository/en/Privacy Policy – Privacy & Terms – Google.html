          <h1>Why Google collects data</h1>
          <p class="vxK8q">We use data to build better services</p>
          <p>We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p>
          <h3>Provide our services</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use your information to , like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.</p>
          <h3>Maintain &amp; improve our services</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We also use your information to , such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to  to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.</p>
          <h3>Develop new services</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.</p>
          <h3>Provide personalized services, including content and ads</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and . For example,  provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.</p>
          <p>Depending on your settings, we may also show you  based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</p>
          <ul>
           <li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on , such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</li>
           <li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.</li>
           <li>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Measure performance</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to  about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.</p>
          <h3>Communicate with you</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.</p>
          <h3>Protect Google, our users, and the public</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use information to help improve the  of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p>
          <hr>

          </ul>
          <h3 id="footnote-unique-id">Unique identifiers</h3>
          <p>A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.</p>
          <p>Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about .</p>
          <p>On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be  in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.</p>

          <h3 id="footnote-ad-services">advertising and research services on their behalf</h3>
          <p>For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-android-device">Android device with Google apps</h3>
          <p>Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-combine-info">combine the information we collect</h3>
          <p>Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. </li>
           <li>If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. </li>
           <li>The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web &amp; App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based your activity. </li>
           <li>If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="footnote-customized-search">customized search results</h3>
          <p>For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web &amp; App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can . You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can  or turn off .</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-deliver-services">deliver our services</h3>
          <p>Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video</li>
           <li>We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account</li>
           <li>Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, animations, and other creations that you can share. </li>
           <li>A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail</li>
           <li>When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="footnote-detect-abuse">detect abuse</h3>
          <p>When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-devices">devices</h3>
          <p>For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-improve">ensure and improve</h3>
          <p>For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-ensure-working">ensure our services are working as intended</h3>
          <p>For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-near-device">Information about things near your device</h3>
          <p>If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. </p>
          <h3 id="footnote-legal">legal process, or enforceable governmental request</h3>
          <p>Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our .</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-make-improvements">make improvements</h3>
          <p>For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-link-info">may link information</h3>
          <p>Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. </p>
          <h3 id="footnote-partner">partner with Google</h3>
          <p>There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. </p>
          <h3 id="footnote-payment-info">payment information</h3>
          <p>For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.</p>
          <p>We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. </p>
          <h3 id="footnote-personalized-ads">personalized ads</h3>
          <p>You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. </p>
          <h3 id="footnote-phone-number">phone number</h3>
          <p>If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. </p>
          <h3 id="footnote-against-abuse">protect against abuse</h3>
          <p>For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-sources">publicly accessible sources</h3>
          <p>For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s language models and build features like Google Translate. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-rely-on-cookies">rely on cookies to function properly</h3>
          <p>For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. </p>
          <h3 id="footnote-safety-reliability">safety and reliability</h3>
          <p>Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.</li>
           <li>The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="footnote-sensitive-categories">sensitive categories</h3>
          <p>When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we  that use our services.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-sensor-data">Sensor data from your device</h3>
          <p>Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-servers">servers around the world</h3>
          <p>For example, we operate data centers located  to help keep our products continuously available for users.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-calls-messages">services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages</h3>
          <p>Examples of these services include:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail</li>
           <li>Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls</li>
           <li>Gmail, for sending and receiving emails</li>
           <li>Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages</li>
           <li>Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages</li>
           <li>Google Fi, for a phone plan</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="footnote-trends">show trends</h3>
          <p>When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. </p>
          <h3 id="footnote-delete-specific">specific Google services</h3>
          <p>For example, you can delete  from Blogger or  from Google Sites. You can also delete  you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-specific-partners">specific partners</h3>
          <p>For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.  about these partners and how they use your information.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-chrome-sync">synced with your Google Account</h3>
          <p>Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. </p>
          <h3 id="footnote-people-online">the people who matter most to you online</h3>
          <p>For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you .</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-third-parties">third parties</h3>
          <p>For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-content-views">Views and interactions with content and ads</h3>
          <p>For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-other-sites">your activity on other sites and apps</h3>
          <p>This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your  and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.</p>
          <p> about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.</p>

          <h1>Why Google collects data</h1>
          <p class="vxK8q">We use data to build better services</p>
          <p>We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p>
          <h3>Provide our services</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use your information to , like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.</p>
          <h3>Maintain &amp; improve our services</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We also use your information to , such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to  to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.</p>
          <h3>Develop new services</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.</p>
          <h3>Provide personalized services, including content and ads</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and . For example,  provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.</p>
          <p>Depending on your settings, we may also show you  based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</p>
          <ul>
           <li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on , such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</li>
           <li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.</li>
           <li>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Measure performance</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to  about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.</p>
          <h3>Communicate with you</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.</p>
          <h3>Protect Google, our users, and the public</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use information to help improve the  of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p>
          <hr>

          <p>If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>
          <p>We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p>

          </ul>
          <h3 id="footnote-unique-id">Unique identifiers</h3>
          <p>A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.</p>
          <p>Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about .</p>

           <li>When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. </li>
           <li>If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. </li>
           <li>The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web &amp; App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based your activity. </li>
           <li>If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. </li>

          <h1>Why Google collects data</h1>
          <p class="vxK8q">We use data to build better services</p>
          <p>We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p>
          <h3>Provide our services</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use your information to , like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.</p>
          <h3>Maintain &amp; improve our services</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We also use your information to , such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to  to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.</p>
          <h3>Develop new services</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.</p>
          <h3>Provide personalized services, including content and ads</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and . For example,  provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.</p>
          <p>Depending on your settings, we may also show you  based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</p>
          <ul>
           <li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on , such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</li>
           <li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.</li>
           <li>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Measure performance</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>

When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to  about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.</p>
          <h3>Communicate with you</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly.

Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.</p>
          <h3>Protect Google, our users, and the public</h3>
          <div class="pjyxF "></div>
          <p>We use information to help improve the  of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p>

          </ul>
          <h3 id="footnote-unique-id">Unique identifiers</h3>
          <p>A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.</p>
          <p>Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about .</p>
          <p>On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be  in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.</p>

We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more  and .</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-ad-services">advertising and research services on their behalf</h3>
          <p>For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-android-device">Android device with Google apps</h3>
          <p>Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.</p>
          <h3 id="footnote-combine-info">combine the information we collect</h3>
          <p>Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. </li>
           <li>If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. </li>
           <li>The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web &amp; App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based your activity. </li>
           <li>If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="footnote-devices">devices</h3>
          <p>For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.</p>
