     <section class="text-images" id="s0"> 
      <p>Employee Repopulation Plan includes a&nbsp;prioritized, staged approach for individual units and divisions to return to campus, based on the operational and functional needs&nbsp;of the university. As an inclusive polytechnic university, we are most effective and impactful when students learn and experience the campus in person.&nbsp;Aug. 2 remains the official start of our , and every office that provides services to students and the university community should be open with in-person staffing during business hours.&nbsp;Faculty are expected to return on Aug. 17 when their contracts begin.</p> 
      <p>As part of this plan, employees are expected to return to on-campus work in the following three stages:&nbsp;</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li><strong>Stage I on May 24</strong>: Pilot of existing on-campus workers and 120 self-designated employee participants across Divisions.</li> 
       <li><strong>Stage II on June 21</strong>: Return of Tier 1 Services as defined by each division based on operational and functional need and in compliance with current Los Angeles County Department of Public Health requirements. Employees will be notified no later than May 28 if they are part of the Stage II return.</li> 
       <li><strong>Stage III on Aug. 2</strong>: Every office that provides services to students and the university community should be open with in-person staffing during the universityâ€™s business hours, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. . Faculty are expected to return on Aug. 17 when their contracts begin.</li>
