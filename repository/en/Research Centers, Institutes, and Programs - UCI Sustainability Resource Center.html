                  <p>As societies become more complex and interconnected, the potential for natural disasters increases. The consequences of global climate change have exacerbated, created, or are in the process of inducing conditions that require an adaptive management response to disasters and medical and public health needs. This includes an evolutionary approach as new challenges arise from increased fire probability to higher predicted seasonal flooding events, coastal erosion and landslides, and an increase in certain, particularly vector borne and novel emerging, infectious diseases. UCI’s Center for Disaster Medical Sciences is adapting to these new challenges so that environments can be maintained in ways that correspond with a management methodology that makes resilience and continued sustainability possible. The Center is at the forefront of the emerging field of disaster medicine, offering innovative approaches to optimize disaster management through research, education, training, and public policy. Current research focuses on surge capacity and crisis care, disaster triage, earthquakes, simulation training, and disaster nomenclature.</p>

                  <p>The Center for Environmental Biology in the School of Biological Sciences was established in March 2010 to facilitate research, education, and outreach in biological science to help develop innovative new solutions to environmental problems. Biological resources are a critical component of environmental sustainability. Land, aquatic, and marine ecosystems provide many essential functions that sustain air, water, climate, food, and social systems. It is increasingly challenging to manage these resources in response to multiple stresses and environmental disturbances such as climate change, pollution, land use change, and exotic species invasions. New advances in biological research are providing methods to better understand how organisms and ecosystems influence the environment and how they respond to environmental change. Working in partnership with ecosystem and resource managers, UCI faculty are collaborating to conduct solutions-oriented research in environmental biology, and to educate the next generation of environmental biologists and stewards of biological resources.</p>

                  <p>The application of molecular and genetic tools to evolutionary questions provides answers to some of the most fundamental questions in biology. For example, phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses illuminate the evolutionary history of life, population genetics provides insight into current processes of gene flow and natural selection, and studies that incorporate experimental evolution and functional genetics can give us a preview of future evolutionary trajectories. The utility and power of modern genetic techniques can be applied to a diverse array of academic disciplines, including studies of aging, behavior, infectious disease, cancer, genomic evolution and the domestication of plants and animals.</p>

                  <p>The Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies (CGPACS) is a multi-disciplinary program founded in 1983, housed in the School of Social Sciences, and dedicated to promoting scholarly, student and public understanding of international peace and conflict. CGPACS-affiliated faculty (more than 60 faculty from 7 schools across campus), guest speakers, and affiliated graduate students work on the military/strategic, economic/environmental and cultural/normative motives, processes, and consequences of both peace and conflict. Current CGPACS programs approach the theme <em>Thinking past the Unthinkable: Opportunities and Challenges for Global Peace</em> in three related areas: <em>Biosecurity and the New Realities of Global Warming</em>; <em>Financial Crisis: Peace and Conflict in the New Normal</em>; and <em>Rethinking Peace and Conflict after the Arab Spring</em>. <em>Biosecurity and the New Realities of Global Warming</em>, the first CGPACS sub-theme, is particularly relevant to sustainability. Global warming poses a challenge to received wisdom about peace and conflict in the world. Bringing together the considerable expertise on the UCI campus, in partnership with local, regional and international experts, CGPACS looks at the numerous challenges to peace and potential for conflict posed by peak water and peak oil.</p>

                  In his keynote address at a 2012 NSF-funded National Academies symposium, John Holdren, head of&nbsp;the US Office of Science and Technology Policy and chief science advisor to the nation, spoke at&nbsp;length about climate change, and described a need for both mitigation – the reduction of the&nbsp;magnitude of change – and adaptation – the mobilization of responses to change. Holdren advocated&nbsp;for the development of technology that focuses on “meeting human needs [and] wants at lower cost&nbsp;with reduced use of material resources [and] reduced environmental impact.” The Center for&nbsp;Research in Sustainability, Collapse-Preparedness &amp; Information Technology (RiSCIT) seeks to&nbsp;engage with this challenge, in part due to the potential for “greening through IT” – that is, making&nbsp;civilizations more environmentally sustainable via IT interventions and in part as means of preparing&nbsp;for civilizational collapse. The goal of the RiSCIT center is to provide a central focus for research on&nbsp;the role of informatics and computing in supporting the transition to sustainability and addressing the&nbsp;potential to prepare for civilization-scale collapse.

                  <p>Global environmental change, technological innovation, economic globalization, and the spread of democracy have dramatically transformed the security landscape. While the incidence of war has declined, other, unconventional threats have moved onto the agenda, such as climate change, cybercrime and complex disasters. These threats to human security and national security have become as important as the traditional threat of war. Security today depends as much on investments into promoting sustainability, alleviating poverty and facilitating cooperation as into intelligence and defense. The Center for Unconventional Security Affairs (CUSA) was established in 2003. Its Unconventional Security Research Group studies and develops solutions to unconventional security challenges through interdisciplinary field research. CUSA’s Transformational Media Lab explores the use of media in communicating these challenges and moving people from concern to action. The eARTh Studio provides a platform for artists who create art informed by these issues. CUSA also focuses on supporting leaders in the business, government and non-profit communities who are trying to address these challenges, and on educating the next generation of leaders by integrating students into all aspects of the Center’s activities. In 2010, the Center launched a Sustainability Seminar Series that continues today.</p>

                  <p>The Community Knowledge Project is a practice that explicitly addresses the systems and structures of inequality in which all humans and non-humans live. The Community Knowledge Project is inspired by the Environmental Justice Movements around the globe where expertise itself is challenged and redefined.&nbsp;&nbsp;(2006) nicely details the promise of local knowledge for a new generation of scholars that seek a connection rather than domination or mastery over their subjects/objects of interest. His is an introduction and a doorway into a situated knowledge making practice that includes, on equal footing, expert and local knowledge makers. Neither takes an upper hand for Coburn. Rather, expert and local knowledge practices share many qualities that make the dichotomy only useful as a mnemonic, not as epistemological or ontological truism. Because community health issues are inherently multidimensional, students from all departments and backgrounds are encouraged to become involved.</p>
