 In recognition of Hispanic Heritage Month, we’re highlighting several Hispanic members of the Cal Poly Pomona community whose contributions and accomplishments have made an impact on our campus and beyond. As the most diverse polytechnic university in the country, CPP is fortunate to benefit from such great role models for the Hispanic community and the Cal Poly Pomona community.

 Rosalia Armas   
 Graduate Student, Azusa Pacific University   
 Alumna Rosalia Armas cleared many hurdles   and seemed to thrive no matter the circumstance. The first-generation college student had her daughter, Lillian, while attending CPP and managed to finish her last semester despite the challenges of caring for her daughter while taking classes remotely. Through it all, Armas (’21, sociology) wasn’t just a mother and a college student, but also an involved Associated Students Inc. representative and a researcher.
