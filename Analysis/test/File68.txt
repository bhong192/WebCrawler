 2021 Annual Security Report 
 
 
 
 
 Message from the President 
 Focused on our mission to cultivate student success and scholarly excellence through experiential learning, discovery and innovation, Cal Poly Pomona serves as the model for an inclusive polytechnic university. Our core values of academic achievement, diversity, inclusion and community engagement define all that we do, and as we work to foster an environment that supports this mission, the safety and wellbeing of our campus community is our top priority. 
 Cal Poly Pomona publishes an Annual Security Report to keep the campus informed about our public safety procedures and policies, crime statistics and emergency management protocols. It also contains information about crime reporting, crime prevention, victim’s rights and other important services. I invite all members of our community to review the report and to become familiar with the public safety resources available at Cal Poly Pomona. 
 Campus safety is a team effort. It is important that each of us look out for one another and be alert for potentially unsafe situations. It is critical that all members of our campus community are engaged and informed about safety-related services, emergency preparedness and crime prevention. 
 Working together, we will continue to keep Cal Poly Pomona a great place to live, learn and work. 
 Soraya M. Coley President
